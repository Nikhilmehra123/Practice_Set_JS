// Is JavaSrcipt case sensitive? Give an example?
// Yes, JavaScript is case sensitive.
// for example, a function parseInt is not same as the funtion Parseint.
// builtIn or default method are always camel case
// But we can write our funtion funtion anything uppercase or lowercase it will not show any error.
