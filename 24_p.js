// function getData() {
//   console.log("Hey I am getting the data");
// }

// getData(); // what here we can learn from this is only by defining getData() outside the funtion we can see the output

// IIFE:
// functional expressions
(function getData() {
  console.log("Hey this is nikhil");
})();
