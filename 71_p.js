// Explain Template Literals in ES6?

// Template literals are strings with embedded code and variables inside them.
// Template literals allows us concatenation and interpolation in much more clear and easy way.
// E.g
let city = "dalls";
let state = "Texas";
let output = `You have enterered options as ${city} ${state}`;
console.log(output);
