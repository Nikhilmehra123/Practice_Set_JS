// Define unenscape() and escape() functions ?

// The escape() function is responsible for coding a string so as to make the transfer of the information form one computer to the other, across a network.
// The unescape() function is very important as it decodes the coded string.

console.log(escape("Hello How are doing today"));

console.log(unescape("Hello%20How%20are%20doing%20today"));
