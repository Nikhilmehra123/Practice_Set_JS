// what is saas?
// Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome StyleSheet.
// sass is an extension to CSS
// sass is a css pre-processor
// sass is completely compatible with all versions of css.
// sass reduces repetition of Css and therefore saves time
// sass was designed by Hampton catlin and developed by natalie Weizenbaum in 2006.
// sass is free to download and use.

// Why use Saas?
//  stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. this is where a css pre-processor can help.
// Saas let you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in funtions, and other stuff.

//  Example of using Saas variables.
//  $bgcolor: lightblue;
//  $textcolor: darkblue;
//  $fontsize: 18px;

//    body{
//     background-color :$bgcolor;
//     color:$textcolor;
//     font-size:$fontsize;
//    }
