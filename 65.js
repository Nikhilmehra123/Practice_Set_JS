// Difference between display and visibility ?
// visibility:hidden; and display:none are totally different properties used in css property.
// display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all although you can still interact with it through the dom).
// there will be no space allocated for it between the other tags.
// visibility:hidden  means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page. The tag is
// rendered, it just isn't seen on the page.
